This directory contains the firmware required for the STM32F103 Minimum System Development Board to function as CNC controller.

It was written using SW4STM32. To flash this into the board without installing the full toolchain use either a STLink v2 programming adapter and ST's STLink tool, or connect a TTL-level serial port to the STM32F1's serial port, change the BOOT0 pin jumper, and use the bootloader included in the chip together with your favorite DFU tool.
